TODO List
---------

  - Check for availability of nickname on join, and select a different one
     until one is available.
  - Implement more callbacks for `mt_irc.register_callback'.

Not TODO List
-------------
* These things either WON'T BE SUPPORTED, or have VERY LOW priority.

  - Support for sending CTCP queries (LuaIRC seems to handle incoming
     queries internally by default).

Known Bugs
----------

  - Apparently, some users have to install `luasocket' separately, since
     the provided one won't compile/work (reported by leo_rockway).
