Version 0.1.2:
    - Fixed the Quit: Excess Flood bug.
    - Removed the `packmod' scripts in favor of a dedicated CMake target.
    - Fixed packaging of mod under MinGW32.
    - Export some basic API so other mods may use the connection to send
       messages, etc.
    - Added /irc_disconnect and /irc_reconnect chat commands.
    - Added some basic documentation about the API exported by this mod.
       More coming soon.
    - Added automatic reconnection in case the bot is kicked from the
       channel.
    - Fixed delay while the bot waits for the Message Of The Day (or topic)
    - Fixed bug where players were able to send messages to the channel
       even if they had no `shout' priv.

Version 0.1.1:
    - Moved all user configuration to `config.lua'.
    - Added formatted messages for sent and received messages and options
       to change them.
    - Added options to change port, password.
    - Added support for sending/receiving private messages.
    - Removed need for separate packmod.{sh|bat} scripts. Now everything
       is (almost) nicely handled by CMake.
    - Now all sources (including Lua itself) are added to a single
       luasocket lib. This will hopefully fix some cases where the linker
       b0rk3d with undefined references under Linux.
    - Added option to enable/disable connecting when starting the game, and
       the /irc_connect chat command to connect manually to the server (as
       suggested by OldCoder). The /irc_connect chat command requires the
       `irc_admin' privilege.
    - Added option to enable/disable joining the channel when a player joins,
       and the /join and /part chat commands to join and part the channel
       manually if desired (as suggested by OldCoder).

Version 0.1.0:
    - At least it's working :)
